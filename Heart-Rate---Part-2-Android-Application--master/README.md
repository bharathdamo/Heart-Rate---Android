I have created a database for a patient (DB name should be the same with your application name such as group number). On entering the patient name, ID, age, and sex,  app  instantiates a database with table name Name_ID_Age_Sex. The table will have four columns: a) time stamp, b) x values, c) y values, and d) z values. Then app initiates a service that will connect to an accelerometer and collect data at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. The data will be stored in the table with the time stamp of a sample and the raw three axes values of the accelerometer. Whenever one hits the Run button the most recent 10 second data is pulled from the database and showed in the graph.
The data is updated every second. When stop button is hit the graph is cleared.
