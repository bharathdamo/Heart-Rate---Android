# Heart-Rate---Android-Application
Developed an heart rate UI for android phones using Android studio. Generated a sample array of floats using the random library to plot. Whenever the “Run button” is hit, the array is plotted in the canvass, on clicking the “Stop button”, graph is cleared. When you click the “Run button” again, drawing the graph is restarted continuously (without clearing the previous graph).  Also, the graph will be drawn and moved continuously before “Stop button” is clicked such as real heartbeat signal.
